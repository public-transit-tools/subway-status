# SubwayStatus.com
SubwayStatus.com is a platform designed to provide clear, up-to-date information about subway systems around the world. The project aims to make it easy for riders to check the status of their local subway network, including service changes, slow zones, and other important updates, all in a simple and modern interface.

## Project Structure
### Landing Page
The main site (subwaystatus.com) serves as a welcoming landing page, introducing the project and its mission.
It provides a central place for users to discover which subway systems are currently supported.
### Network List
The "Networks" page lists all subway systems available on the platform.
Each system is accessible via its own subdomain (e.g., ttc.subwaystatus.com for Toronto's TTC).
As of now, the only supported system is the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).
### System Subdomains
Each supported subway system has its own dedicated subdomain, offering detailed, system-specific status, maps, and features.
Example: ttc.subwaystatus.com
## Vision & Future Plans
Scalable: The platform is designed to easily add more subway systems from cities around the world.
User-Focused: Simple, fast, and mobile-friendly design for quick access to essential information.
Open Data: Where possible, the project uses open data sources and aims to be transparent about data origins.
Community-Driven: Contributions and suggestions for new systems or features are welcome.
